This is an app developed using Flutter. The homepage features four national parks, each intended to provide users with travel information. Upon selecting a national park from the first page, users will be directed to its official website. If users desire more information about a specific national park, they can access this link. This approach eliminates the need to individually search each official website, allowing users to access all the information through the app.

Currently, there are three hiking trails available. The trail pages are designed to incorporate sensors, creating real-time data transmission on the map. Tapping on a trash bin icon provides a value ranging from 0% to 100%, indicating the remaining capacity of the bin. This feature informs users about the available space in the trash bin.

Furthermore, there is a feature displaying the number of people on the trail. The purpose of this feature is to help visitors gauge the crowd density at a particular location, enabling them to avoid heavily congested areas.

Lastly, the map displays restroom icons to guide users and prevent them from relieving themselves in inappropriate places. This setup contributes to the preservation of the natural environment.
